If the item King's Rock is held it does not increase that percentage, but rather if the move does not cause flinching (40% chance), then there is now a further 20% chance the target will flinch from King's Rock.

If the item King's Rock is held it does not increase that percentage, but rather if the move does not cause flinching (40% chance), then there is now a further 20% chance the target will flinch from King's Rock. This means Serene Grace with Air Slash and King's Rock gives a total probability of 68% (1 - 0.4*0.8) that the opponent will flinch.In Generations 3-4 Serene Grace does not increase the flinch chance of King's Rock or Razor Fang.In Generations 3-5 Serene Grace does not affect the move Secret Power."

If the item King's Rock is held it does not increase that percentage, but rather if the move does not cause flinching (40% chance), then there is now a further 20% chance the target will flinch from King's Rock. This means Serene Grace with Air Slash and King's Rock gives a total probability of 68% (1 - 0.4*0.8) that the opponent will flinch.In Generations 3-4 Serene Grace does not increase the flinch chance of King's Rock or Razor Fang.In Generations 3-5 Serene Grace does not affect the move Secret Power."
